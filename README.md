## The Canadian Press Charts

**What are they**

This is a collection of charts that I have made that we use at the Canadian Press. They're mostly made using d3.js to create and manipulate SVGs. Most of them use .csv files as a data source. They are designed to be quick to deploy. Just write a headline and intro and change the data source and then deploy.

**Where they work**

Designed to work from anywhere from 300px wide to 960px wide inside iframes on a client's site. They were designed like that because I don't have direct access to a client's website. So everything needs to work in an iframe and on mobile.

This is a back up of the Canadian Press' code. You'd have to ask them if you want to use it. Get a hold of lucas.timmons@thecanadianpress.com.
