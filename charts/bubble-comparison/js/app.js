        speeches: ["CONSERVATIVES: Mr. Speaker, I rise before this House today to table the\nbudget documents for 2015, including notices of ways\nand means motions.\nThe details of the measures are contained in these documents,\nand I am asking that an order of the day be designated for\nconsideration of these motions.\nI also wish to announce that the Government will introduce\nlegislation to implement the measures in the budget.\nMr. Speaker, I am proud to present Economic Action Plan 2015\nñ our Government's plan for growth and opportunity. It is a\nprudent and principled plan that will see Canadians more\nprosperous, more secure, and ever more confident in our\ncountry's place in the world.\nThe story of Canada is ñ has always been ñ the story\nof opportunity.\nOpportunity is what has drawn people here from around the\nworld, generation after generation. It is what draws them still.\nOpportunity for themselves and for their families, the\nopportunity to work hard, dream big, and achieve those dreams.\nOn a personal note, I will be forever grateful to my\ngrandparents for their fateful decision to immigrate to Canada\nmore than a hundred years ago. Like so many others, they\nchose liberation over oppression, opportunity over stagnation ñ\na bright future over a gathering storm.\nThe federal budget is, on the face of it, about dollars and cents.\nBut on a more fundamental level it is a path to opportunity, and\nit is in this spirit that I present it today.\nI do so acknowledging that we live in what continue to be\nchallenging times.\nAround the world, many nations ñ including some of our\nfriends and allies ñ remain mired in a struggle for fiscal\nsecurity. Global growth coming out of the Great Recession has\nbeen lacklustre.\nGeopolitical uncertainty continues to hobble the recovery.\nAnd, of course, the dramatic plunge in oil prices has taken its\ntoll on our economy.\nStill, the news for Canada is, by and large, good. Amid the\ntumult, our country remains a beacon of economic stability and\nsecurity built on a foundation of sound financial management.\nNow, I cannot go further, Mr. Speaker, without saluting the\nman who ñ through fiscal acumen, careful stewardship, and\nlove of country ñ can take so much credit for this: my\npredecessor, Jim Flaherty.\nIt is because of Mr. Flaherty's efforts, and the leadership of our\nPrime Minister, that we are in a position to move forward.\nIt is because of their disciplined and deliberate choices in dark\ntimes that, rather than privation and painful austerity, we face a\nfuture of opportunity and possibilities.\nThat path is the right path for Canada.\nI recall the words of another man who, half a century ago,\nserved as Canada's Minister of Finance, the Honourable\nDonald Fleming.\nLike me, he was a proud member of a Conservative\ngovernment; and like me, he had the honour of representing the\ngood people of Eglinton, the predecessor to my own riding of\nEglintonñLawrence, in the great city of Toronto.\nìWe have withstood the disturbing calm of recession, and the\nwinds of prosperity again fill our sails,î he told this House.\nìWith a united, determined and confident population, Canada\nmarches on unflinchingly towards its bright destiny.î\nMr. Speaker, our economy is now substantially larger than it\nwas pre-recession, a performance that remains the envy of\nthe G-7.\nInternational observers expect Canada's growth ñ already\nahead of our peers during the recovery ñ to continue to be solid,\nand that our net debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to be the\nlowest in the G-7.\nThe causes of global financial challenges are complex ñ and\nlargely beyond our control. But our responses, the choices we\nhave made, have been direct and unambiguous.\nWe have cut taxes to their lowest level in more than half\na century.\nWe have made the largest long-term federal infrastructure\ncommitment in our country's history.\nWe have negotiated free-trade deals that encompass more than\nhalf the global economy.\nWe have increased transfers to the provinces and territories\nto record levels to support health care and education.\nAnd we have done all this while controlling spending.\nFor generations, Canadian families have understood the path\nto prosperity:\nDon't compromise tomorrow by spending recklessly today.\nDon't pile on debt you can't afford.\nAnd invest sensibly for a secure future.\nFor governments, the principles are the same.\nWe have been prudent. We have been practical. And we have\nstuck to our plan.\nBALANCING THE BUDGET\nMr. Speaker, I am proud to announce this budget is balanced.\nThis year, we are forecasting a $1.4 billion surplus,\nand growing surpluses thereafter.\nNow, this did not just happen. It took hard work, unwavering\nfocus and firm resolve.\nSome underestimate the discipline involved, suggesting that\nbudgets ìbalance themselves.î They do not understand what it\ntakes, or why it matters so much. Perhaps they never will.\nBut a balanced budget is the only way to ensure long-term\nprosperity for Canadians.\nIt clears the way for further tax relief.\nIt bolsters our top credit rating, supports lower interest\npayments, and inspires greater consumer and\ninvestor confidence.\nIt protects health care and education.\nIt strengthens our ability to respond to the unavoidable and\nunexpected in a volatile world.\nAnd it means we can leave our children and grandchildren an\neven more secure and prosperous country, not a hangover from\nreckless selfishness.\nWhen our Government first came to power, we worked hard to\nreduce Canada's substantial federal debt. We did it in short\norder, by more than $37 billion.\nThen, in 2008, the world was rocked by the greatest financial\nmeltdown since the Great Depression. It was not a crisis of our\nmaking, but it was nonetheless one we could not escape.\nSo we undertook extraordinary measures to protect the\nfinancial security of Canadians. But we did it with a clear and\nprudent plan to return to balance.\nWe cannot borrow our way to prosperity ñ no matter what our\nopponents might say.\nTheir path ñ the path of spending money we do not have, on\nbureaucratic programs we do not need ñ leads to the crushing\nstructural deficits that plagued this country for years.\nMr. Speaker, when our opponents tried it, they found\nthemselves in an economic swamp of their own creation.\nAnd by the time they figured out the disaster the country was\nfacing, the only way out was brutal cuts to programs Canadians\ncount on.\nGeorge Santayana said: ìThose who cannot remember the past\nare condemned to repeat it.î\nStill, given the chance, they seem determined to try it again.\nIgnoring the lessons of history, they would take the well-trod\nroad to economic decline ñ a journey that will not end well.\nWhen our Government launched its stimulus program, we\nmade a solemn promise to the Canadian people.\nA promise made, a promise kept. Mr. Speaker, this budget is\nwritten in black ink.\nThis is the responsible way forward for Canada, which is why\nwe will also introduce balanced budget legislation.\nThis legislation will recognize that in times of crisis a deficit\nmay be the appropriate action ñ but only with a plan to return\nto balance, and only with an accompanying freeze on\noperating spending.\nSUPPORT FOR CANADIAN FAMILIES\nNow, Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk about tax restraint.\nOur approach has been clear, and consistent: Take as little as\npossible, and give back as much as we can.\nIt all starts right at the bedrock of our country: the family.\nRaising a family is hard work, and unlike our opponents, we\nprefer to leave it to the experts: Mom and Dad.\nIt also costs a lot of money, which is why in recent months we\nexpanded the Universal Child Care Benefit, introduced the\nFamily Tax Cut, increased the Child Care Expense Deduction\nlimits and doubled the Children's Fitness Tax Credit.\nThese measures will make life more affordable for all Canadian\nfamilies with children.\nFor a typical two-earner family of four, it means up to an extra\n$6,600 in their pockets in 2015.\nHelping families now is vital. But just as important is helping\nthem plan for a secure future.\nOne low-tax measure we are particularly proud of is the Tax-\nFree Savings Account. When we introduced TFSAs in Budget\n2008, it was the most significant boost to Canadians' ability to\nsave for their future since the creation of the RRSP.\nSince then, close to 11 million Canadians ñ mostly low and\nmiddle-income Canadians ñ have opened a TFSA.\nWho are these Canadians? They are the people you see in the\ncoffee shop and at the rink and in your place of worship. Half\nmake less than $42,000 a year.\nSome are saving money to buy their first home, or to start their\nfirst business. Some are saving to put their children through\ncollege or university. Others are putting away extra income to\nmake their hard-earned retirement more comfortable and\nenjoyable. In fact, more than half the people currently maxing\nout their TFSA contributions are low and middle-income\nCanadians over the age of 55.\nSo, Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to announce that we will\nincrease the TFSA annual contribution limit, from the current\n$5,500 to $10,000.\nThis is another promise made, and another promise kept.\nSUPPORT FOR CANADIANS\nWITH DISABILITIES\nWe are also working to make life easier for the almost four\nmillion Canadians living with some form of disability.\nMany Canadians with disabilities, as well as seniors, want to\nenjoy greater independence living in the comfort of their\nhomes. To help, we will create a new and permanent Home\nAccessibility Tax Credit, which will support those who want to\nrenovate their dwellings to make them safer, more accessible\nand more functional.\nOur Government has a strong record of support for people with\nAutism Spectrum Disorders, and the people who love them.\nOur budget builds on this, with funding to pursue a greater\nunderstanding of autism and the needs of those living with\nits unique challenges.\nWe will also implement changes to the Copyright Act to\nimplement the Marrakesh Treaty, allowing the one million\nCanadians with visual impairments greater access to adapted\nbooks and other printed material.\nSUPPORT FOR SENIORS\nWe want older Canadians to enjoy the golden years that are\ntheir reward after decades of hard work and diligent saving.\nOur Government has already greatly expanded the Guaranteed\nIncome Supplement for very-low-income seniors.\nToday, I am pleased to announce that we will give seniors more\nchoice when it comes to managing their retirement income, by\nreducing the minimum withdrawal requirements for Registered\nRetirement Income Funds.\nSUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS\nFor more and more Canadians, caring for family not only\nmeans making sure the kids get the best start possible in life.\nIt means being there for parents and other elderly relatives\nthrough their final days.\nWhen someone you love is gravely ill, you should be free\nto focus on what matters most.\nThis is why we are extending the Employment Insurance\nCompassionate Care Benefits period from the current six weeks\nto six months.\nSUPPORT FOR JOB-CREATING BUSINESSES\nAlong with supporting Canadian families, our Government's\npriority has always been the creation and protection of\nopportunity for Canadians. Indeed, since the depth of the global\nrecession, Canada has had one of the best job-creation records\nin the G-7.\nHow did we do this?\nWe cut taxes, and slashed red tape. And we will continue to\ndo both.\nNow, it is no secret that small businesses are critical to the\nhealth of the Canadian economy. They employ half of all\nCanadians in the private sector, and contribute over 40% of our\nprivate-sector GDP.\nThat is why we have worked so hard to support them over the\nyears, and continue to do so.\nWe have lowered the small business tax rate to 11% and\nincreased the amount of annual income eligible for this\nlower rate.\nToday, I am pleased to announce that our Government will\nreduce the tax rate further, all the way down to 9% by 2019.\nThis will be the largest tax rate cut for small businesses in more\nthan 25 years.\nSmall businesses across the country will be able to use these\nadditional tax savings to fuel growth, invest in capital and hire\nmore people.\nSUPPORT FOR MANUFACTURING\nManufacturing accounts for more than 10% of our GDP and\nover 60% of our merchandise exports and employs 1.7 million\npeople all across the country.\nSome have questioned the role of manufacturing in Canada's\nfuture economic success. We do not. For this Government,\nthe words ìMade in Canadaî continue to fuel pride and\ninspire confidence.\nBut we must give manufacturers the tools they need to create\nthe products ñ and the jobs ñ of the future.\nThis is why I am pleased to announce that we will help to boost\nthis sector's productivity by introducing a 10-year investment\nincentive that will allow a faster write-off for machinery\nand equipment.\nWe are also launching the Automotive Supplier Innovation\nProgram. This investment of $100 million over the next five\nyears will support our auto parts industry as it meets the\nconstantly evolving demands of automakers and consumers.\nSUPPORT FOR WORKERS AND STUDENTS\nWe will continue our collaboration with the provinces and\nterritories in skills training. We will also bring employers and\neducators together to make sure the skills of our graduates\nmatch the needs of our economy.\nFor Canada's best and brightest graduate and post-graduate\nstudents, we will increase our support for internships that allow\nthem to focus on industry-related research.\nFor students who need to work to put themselves through\nschool, the current in-study income limit of the Canada Student\nLoans program is a barrier. We will remove it.\nWe will also reduce the program's parental contribution\nrequirement to make it easier for middle-class families to\nfinance the education of their children.\nWe will make permanent our Foreign Credential Recognition\nLoans program, which helps skilled newcomers cover the costs\nof having their qualifications recognized here.\nAnd we will extend the Working While on Claim Employment\nInsurance pilot project, which gives unemployed Canadians the\nability to accept some work ñ work that could lead to learning\nnew skills or even full-time employment ñ while protecting\ntheir EI benefits.\nSUPPORT FOR SCIENCE AND RESEARCH\nMr. Speaker, Canada is now attracting the best and brightest\nminds from around the globe in science, research and\ndevelopment.\nTo build on this success, we will make a significant new\ninvestment of $1.3 billion over six years through the Canada\nFoundation for Innovation, to ensure our researchers continue\nto have the leading-edge lab facilities they need to be the best\nin the world.\nWhile all their work is about changing lives, some of it is about\nsaving them. A case in point: The Canadian Institutes of Health\nResearch has been searching for a solution to drug-resistant\ninfections. We will provide stable, multi-year funding for this\nimportant work.\nAnd to help meet the challenges of an aging population, we will\nlikewise provide stable, multi-year funding toward the\nestablishment of the Canadian Centre for Aging and Brain\nHealth Innovation, based at Baycrest Health Sciences\nin Toronto.\nSUPPORT FOR OUR CITIES\nSince the era of the Last Spike, infrastructure has been vital to\nCanada's success as a country ñ which is why it is a key\npriority for our Government. Our New Building Canada Plan is\nthe largest long-term federal investment in infrastructure in our\ncountry's history.\nIndeed, our investment in infrastructure is three times greater\nthan the previous government's.\nBut building this great country is a project that never ends.\nAnyone who lives in or near our thriving and fast-growing\ncities knows the reality of traffic gridlock.\nSo I am pleased to announce the launch of a major new\ninfrastructure program: the Public Transit Fund. This program,\nincreasing to $1 billion per year by 2019, will be a permanent\nsource of funding to provinces and municipalities for major\npublic transit projects.\nThis fund will result in more money for more transit projects by\nrequiring a significant role for the private sector and by\nallowing for a more flexible payment approach.\nIt will also drive greater efficiency in the design and costing of\ntransit projects.\nCanada is home to some of the world's largest and most\nexperienced private-sector infrastructure investors. This fund\nwill require their involvement and expertise to deliver projects\nin a manner that is affordable for taxpayers and efficient\nfor commuters.\nSUPPORT FOR OUR NATURAL\nRESOURCES INDUSTRIES\nCanada's prosperity has always been rooted in our wealth of\nnatural resources. From the bounty of our seas to the abundance\nof the earth, these riches provide good, well-paying jobs for\nalmost two million Canadians.\nMeasures we will take to support this sector include the Forest\nInnovation Program and Expanding Market Opportunities\nProgram to help Canadian forestry companies adopt emerging\ntechnologies and develop new markets for Canada's wood\nproduct exports.\nAnd, Mr. Speaker, when someone makes working the land or\nthe sea their life's work, they have earned everything they have\nput into that enterprise. So we will also raise the Lifetime\nCapital Gains Exemption to $1 million for those who make\ntheir livelihood farming or fishing.\nWe are proud of our record when it comes to the responsible\ndevelopment of our natural resources, and will continue to\npursue the vast opportunities with which we are blessed. At the\nsame time, we will only proceed with projects that are safe for\nCanadians and safe for our environment.\nMr. Speaker, we take this stewardship seriously. We are the\nonly government in our nation's history to reduce Canada's\ngreenhouse gas emissions ñ proof that emissions can decline\neven as economic growth increases.\nTo build on this record of good stewardship, Economic Action\nPlan 2015 includes investments to enhance marine\ntransportation safety in the Arctic as well as to strengthen\nenvironmental protection, spill prevention and response\nmeasures in Canadian waters.\nPROTECTING CANADIANS\nNow, Mr. Speaker, I want to address the dangerous world we\nlive in. We say this often, because it is true: Government has no\ngreater responsibility than protecting the lives of its people.\nOur Government understands the present dangers ñ and is\ndetermined to respond responsibly, without ambiguity or\nmoral equivocation.\nTherefore, this budget includes measures to ensure the\ncontinued security of Canadians.\nFirst, it must be said: The jihadist terrorists who proclaimed a\nso-called ìcaliphateî in the Middle East have declared war on\nCanada and Canadians by name. In response, we have taken up\nthe fight both overseas and here at home.\nWe are eternally grateful to the men and women in uniform\nwho put their lives on the line every day defending our\nfreedoms. Our Government will ensure they continue to have\nwhat they need to accomplish the dangerous tasks Canadians\nask of them. We will increase the annual escalator for National\nDefence's budget to 3% starting in 2017-18. As a result, our\nspending on Canada's military will increase by $11.8 billion\nover 10 years.\nMeanwhile, the RCMP and CSIS will have new resources not\nonly to investigate and prevent further terrorist attacks on\nCanadian soil, but to protect vulnerable young people\nsusceptible to the lies and manipulation of ISIS recruiters,\npreventing them from throwing away their lives by travelling\nabroad to join the terrorists' reprehensible cause.\nThreats to Canada are not limited to jihadis with guns and\nbombs. We will also protect Canada's most vital and essential\nservices, including financial systems and communication grids.\nOur Government has also focused on making our streets and\ncommunities safer from crime, and putting the concerns of\nvictims at the heart of our justice system.\nOur Government has always supported strong communities,\nfirm in our belief that they are the foundation of the nation.\nCentral to making our communities great is the willingness of\nCanadians to help others. Today I am happy to say we will\nmake that easier to do.\nWe will create a capital gains tax exemption for public-spirited\nCanadians who wish to donate private shares or real estate\nwhen the proceeds of their sale are directed to a charity.\nFor Canadians who support loved ones in other countries, we\nwill take steps to make sure more of their money makes it to\nthe recipient, and less is gobbled up in administrative costs.\nAnd to assist Canadian businesses that want to invest in\ndeveloping countries while helping pull those countries out of\npoverty, we will establish a Development Finance Initiative to\nprovide financing, technical assistance and business advisory\nservices to firms operating in developing countries.\nMr. Speaker, this entire budget is about our unflinching march\ninto the future. So we must never forget our rich and inspiring\nhistory, because that history guides our future.\nAs our sesquicentennial approaches, we have set aside\nsubstantial funds for the celebrations, both on a national scale\nand at the community level.\nAlmost 150 years ago, the Fathers of Confederation had grand\ndreams and ambitions.\nIf they could see us now, I think they would be pleased with the\nCanada we have become.\nWe have been through some trying times, but now our hard\nwork ñ the hard work of all Canadians ñ is paying off. Those\nìwinds of prosperityî are powering us toward an even\nbrighter future.\nThese are times of immense opportunity for Canada ñ but also\nof substantial risk.\nThe choices we make can assure a secure and prosperous\nCanada for generations to come.\nTogether, let us make the greatest country in the world,\neven greater.\n"]

        name: "LIBERAL",
        speeches: ["LIBERAL: Mr. Speaker, \nToday, we begin to restore hope for the middle class. \nToday, we begin to revitalize the economy. \nToday, we begin a long-term plan that will use smart investments and an unwavering belief that progress is possible to ensure that Canada’s best days lie ahead. \nI know that this can be done. Canadians have done it before. \nAfter the dark days of the Great Depression and the Second World War, Canadians believed the future could be brighter. \nThey believed that if they worked hard and saved, they could get ahead. \nThey could buy a car and a house. They could send their children to college or university. They could look forward to a decent retirement. \nAnd they could hope that their children would do even better than they did. Confidence inspired investment. Investment inspired confidence. \nIn the post-war years, Canadians built the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Trans-Canada Highway. They constructed new airports, subways, pipelines and communication networks. They created new colleges and universities—and parents sent their children to those institutions in record numbers. \nThese investments made the workforce skilled and educated. They connected communities. They improved access to markets. They made the flow of people, goods and services faster and cheaper. \nThe economy grew rapidly. And Canadians prospered. \nHope and hard work were rewarded. Well, Canadians are not so optimistic today. That’s understandable. \nThe decline in the price of oil and other commodities has hurt whole regions and provinces. \nEconomic growth has slowed. Wages haven’t grown significantly since the 1970s. \nI want you to imagine an ordinary middle class Canadian family. Two parents with two kids in university. \nThe parents have been working for 25 years, the bills are growing, and it’s been hard to get ahead. \nThere’s nothing left at the end of the month. And they don’t know if they’ll ever be able to afford a decent retirement. \nIt’s no surprise that many Canadians feel they are worse off than their parents were at the same age—and that they feel the next generation will do worse than their own. \nA fundamental change must happen: Canadians need to believe that hope and hard work will be rewarded again. \nTo make that change, we first have to see good reasons to be confident about the future. \nThe global economy is evolving rapidly. Digital technology has already transformed how we live and work. These changes will accelerate. For example, clean technologies are improving at an astonishing rate thanks to a torrent of investment and ideas. Markets in Asia present significant business opportunities. \nCanada can be a leader in this new environment. \nOur people are highly educated and skilled. The diversity of our population connects us globally and is a wellspring of innovation. \nWe are at the forefront of scientific research. \nThere will always be those who claim that we should fear change. \nThe reality is that we stand before a historic opportunity to shape and lead this change. \nBut to shape the future, we must invest in the future. We must do for our children and grandchildren what our parents and grandparents did for us. \nFortunately, circumstances for investment are ideal. \nWise management of the nation’s finances back in the 1990s restored Canada’s fiscal health, giving us a debt-to-GDP level today that is by far the lowest of any G7 country. \nAt the same time, our interest rates have never been lower, so we can borrow on excellent terms—as governments are being urged to do by everyone from the IMF to the OECD to the G20. \nOur plan is reasonable and affordable. By the end of our first mandate, Canada’s debt-to-GDP ratio will be lower than it is today. \nThe government will make the investments needed to boost the economy over the long term. \nMr. Speaker, we know balancing kids, careers and personal goals is not easy. People work hard. They expect their government and their economy to work hard for them in return. \nThis budget puts people first and delivers the help Canadians need right now. But it’s about much more than this moment. It is an essential step in a sustained, strategic effort to restore prosperity and optimism. \nHelp for the Middle Class \nThe fate of the middle class and the fate of the country as a whole are one. Canada will not prosper if the middle class doesn’t prosper. \nIn the short term, the collapse of the price of oil and other commodities has strained families and communities in many provinces. To ease the burden, the government is extending Employment Insurance benefits in affected regions, including parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Northern Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador. \nBut the government must do more for families than merely help them through challenging times. That is why, earlier this year, the government cut taxes for middle class Canadians everywhere. \nSince January 1st, roughly 9 million people see more money on every paycheque that they receive. \nTo help pay for this middle class tax cut, we raised taxes for the top 1 per cent. It’s only fair to ask those who can afford it to pay a little more so that we can help those who need it—and strengthen the economy for everyone. \nBut more needs to be done. And with this budget, we will do more. Much more. \nMr. Speaker, I am proud to announce the introduction of the new Canada Child Benefit—a plan to help families more than any other social program since universal health care. \nFamilies with children under 18 will receive the benefit starting in July. The size of each cheque will depend on your family, but 9 out of 10 families will get more help than they do under existing programs. \nA single mom with one child under the age of 6 and earning $30,000 a year will receive an annual benefit of $6,400, tax-free. \nA family with two children earning $90,000 will receive $5,650—an increase of $2,500 from the current system. \nThat is money in the pockets of mom and dad. Money that can go directly to eating healthier food, paying the rent and buying new clothes for back to school. \nThe Canada Child Benefit is the most significant social policy innovation in a generation. It will lift hundreds of thousands of kids up from poverty. \nMr. Speaker, our country has a long and proud history of big, bold, transformative public policies—programs like universal health care, Old Age Security and the Canada Pension Plan. Now we proudly add the Canada Child Benefit to that honourable list. \nLong-Term Growth for the Middle Class \nAs important as government help is, what the Canadian middle class needs most is strong economic growth. That is why the government will make new investments in infrastructure from coast to coast to coast. \nWe all benefit when infrastructure is improved. New roads and bridges allow us to get around faster. Waste treatment plants, sewers and water mains keep water clean. Broadband connects us digitally. Social housing delivers affordable homes. \nThese benefits are obvious. But people don’t always realize that infrastructure is vital to strengthening the economy and growing the middle class. \nConsider something as simple as traffic jams. Everyone knows they’re annoying. But they also slow the movement of people, goods and services—they actually hurt the economy. \nThat’s why an investment in mass transit does much more than make life more pleasant. It boosts the economy. It helps the environment. Not just for today. But for years and decades into the future. \nStudies consistently show that when there is slack in the economy and interest rates are low, for every dollar a government spends on infrastructure, substantially more than $1 of economic activity is generated. \nThese are good investments. \nSome are urgently needed and require the government to act quickly. But in every case, investments will be made with a focus on long-term value—so that Canadians will reap the benefits far into the future. \nTo help families and communities struggling right now, the first phase of our infrastructure plan invests $11.9 billion over five years to modernize and rehabilitate public transit, water and wastewater systems, provide affordable housing, and to protect infrastructure systems from the effects of climate change. \nWe are also investing $3.4 billion over five years to help maintain and upgrade national parks, harbours, federal airports, border infrastructure and support the clean-up of federal contaminated sites across the country. Over the course of the next decade, we will invest more than $120 billion in infrastructure. \nThese investments will accelerate our transition to a low-carbon, clean growth economy, make traffic flow more smoothly, bring high-speed Internet to more rural communities, and deliver so many other benefits for Canadians. \nIt means a father will make it to his daughter’s soccer game on time, a small business owner in rural Manitoba will get her website up and going, and our communities will be better places to live. But most of all, they will deliver a long-term boost to the Canadian economy. \nAn Innovative and Clean Economy \nThe global economy is going through an extraordinary time of change. One thing, however, will never change. The people, companies and countries who create the next economy will prosper. \nCanadians can be those people, create those companies and build that country. To get there, we need to invest in innovation. \nWithin the next year, the government will put forward a new Innovation Agenda which will outline a new vision for Canada’s economy as a centre of global innovation, renowned for its science, technology, resourceful citizens and globally competitive companies. \nUnderpinning the Innovation Agenda will be our plan for real change. But we are not waiting to move ahead. \nToday I am announcing several new, important measures that will boost our capacity to innovate and to grow our economy. \nWe start with post-secondary education. \nPost-Secondary Education \nParents understand that their children’s future depends on the education and skills they get and that post-secondary education has become an important factor in our children’s future success. But every parent knows that post-secondary education is becoming increasingly expensive. The government must do its part to make post-secondary education more accessible. \nWe will increase Canada Student Grant amounts by 50 per cent, from $2,000 to $3,000 per year for students from low-income families, and from $800 to $1,200 per year for students from middle-income families. \n250,000 students across the country from low-income families, 100,000 students from middle-income families and 16,000 part-time students will get more help each year as a result of these measures. \nThat matters. It can be the difference between getting a degree and dropping out. And that can change a life. \nTo help these students gain experience, we will create up to 35,000 additional jobs for young Canadians in each of the next three years under the Canada Summer Jobs program. \nAnd through the Youth Employment Strategy, we will make new investments to create clean jobs. We will also strengthen co-op and on-the-job learning opportunities that will help students land that all-important first job after graduation. \nInvestments in World-Class Institutions and Research \nCanada’s universities, colleges and research institutions attract the best and brightest from around the world to create hubs of discovery and innovation. Hubs that help companies grow and compete in the new economy. \nTo support these centres of excellence, our government will provide the highest annual funding increase in over a decade for discovery research through Canada’s granting councils—an additional $95 million per year. \nI am also announcing that we will invest $2 billion over three years for a new Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund to modernize on-campus research, commercialization and training facilities. \nThe fund is an example of an immediate investment that can make a real difference now, while preparing for future success. Colleges and universities will be able to modernize research labs, retrofit buildings used for advanced training, and expand on-campus incubators that support start-ups as they grow their businesses. It will create cleaner and more modern campuses today, and more economic opportunity tomorrow. \nThese investments all reflect our core belief that the advancement of basic science and the development of intellectual capacity is the foundation of innovation. \nScience, insight and innovation tend to develop in clusters. The most famous of these clusters is Silicon Valley. \nEveryone knows Silicon Valley is the world’s capital of digital technology. But, I’ll tell you, everyone in Silicon Valley knows that Canada’s own Waterloo region is home to some of the most brilliant, innovative minds and companies in the world. \nThis is a model that Canada can and must build on. We believe that businesses, post-secondary institutions, governments and other stakeholders can work together to accelerate economic growth. We will invest $800 million over four years to support innovation networks and clusters designed to increase collaboration and create value through innovation. \nWe need to connect people and their ideas. These clusters are where innovation will happen—innovation that will ensure Canada is at the forefront of technological advancement in the 21st century. \nClean Growth and a Low-Carbon Economy \nInnovation and economic growth are not only good in themselves. They are essential in our struggle against global climate change. \nThanks to the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Canada is once again a champion of clean growth and a speedy transition to a low-carbon economy. \nOur government is determined to work together with our provincial and territorial partners toward the new pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. \nSome believe we must choose between a strong economy and a clean environment. They are simply wrong. We are at a turning point in world history, with the International Energy Agency reporting that the global economy has grown while global carbon emissions haven’t. The IEA credits the widespread adoption of clean energy. This is just a glimpse of the future—a future we want Canada to lead. \nThink about what’s coming. Wherever the sun shines and the wind blows, farmers and landowners can become energy producers. Particularly for rural regions hurt by falling commodity prices, the opportunities for economic diversification are enormous. \nForestry and agri-food are good examples of sectors where the government can help to facilitate the shift toward a cleaner economy, and ensure good jobs in rural areas. \nWe will invest in new clean technology projects that address climate change, air quality, clean water and clean soil to support provincial and territorial actions that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nWe are expanding eligibility for accelerated capital cost allowances in two important emerging areas: power for electric vehicles and electricity storage. We will also launch regional discussions to identify the most promising electricity infrastructure projects to reduce greenhouse gases. \nAs announced by the Prime Minister at the First Ministers Meeting in Vancouver, the government will create a new $2 billion Low Carbon Economy Fund. \nOur concern for the environment isn’t limited to fighting climate change—our government is investing to expand protected areas, develop new national parks and fund ocean and freshwater science. \nWe are all blessed to live in a country of unique and spectacular natural beauty. The trails we hike, the mountains we climb, the beaches we swim—and yes, as the Prime Minister knows, the rivers we paddle—give Canadians a special connection to the natural world. And a special responsibility to steward nature’s many gifts. \nMr. Speaker, our national parks are the most beautiful places on Earth. From Cape Breton to Gwaii Haanas, from Kluane to Point Pelee, we will invest in them as our gift to ourselves and the world on the occasion of Canada’s 150th anniversary in 2017. \nTogether we will share these national treasures with a whole new generation of children—and capture the spirit of the great Canadian road trip. \nBelieving in the Creativity of Canadians \nBelieving in innovation is also believing in the talent and in the creativity of Canadians. We must do more to support our artists and the cultural community in Quebec and across the country. Our cultural industries represent a key sector of our economy. \nCulture is synonymous with creation. It also creates a collective wealth that goes beyond economic benefits and statistics. \nCBC/Radio-Canada is a vital national institution that brings Canadians together and promotes our two official languages, while supporting creation and culture. \nToday, I am announcing that our government will invest $675 million over five years to modernize and revitalize CBC/Radio-Canada in the digital era. \nI am also proud to announce that our government will invest a total of $1.9 billion over five years in the arts and culture sector. \nThese targeted investments will be provided to, among others, the Canada Council for the Arts, Telefilm Canada, the National Film Board and unique programs that will allow our artists once again to shine on the international stage. \nEvidence-Based Policies \nGood policy is impossible without good data. If we are to lift children out of poverty, we must first understand the cause. If we are to provide quality health care for seniors, we must know how many seniors there are and what services they need. If we want to protect minority languages, we need to know where they are spoken. Literally nothing that governments do can be done well without good data. That’s why, led by my colleague the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, our government wasted no time in bringing back the long-form census. \nAnd we’re going to do more. Too often, when we ask for the evidence needed to make informed decisions, we find it just doesn’t exist. For example, we know that many Canadians, particularly British Columbians, are concerned about the effect of foreign ownership in the housing market. Unfortunately, the problem isn’t fully understood. More information is needed. To fill this data gap, and so many others like it, we will support Statistics Canada so that it can improve our understanding of important problems and help us all make better decisions. \nAn Inclusive and Fair Canada \nGrowing our economy is not enough if that growth isn’t shared by the middle class and those working hard to join it. Inequality is on the rise. To thrive, the middle class must be diverse. It has to represent us all—seniors, people living with disabilities, new Canadians, LGBTQ, rural Canadians, urban Canadians—all must benefit from the growth we create together. \nHealth Care \nCanadians overwhelmingly treasure Canada’s publicly funded, universal health care system. Parents don’t fear that treating a sick child will bankrupt them. Seniors know they won’t be turned away at the hospital. This is a source of national pride. It reflects our values, our generous nature and our commitment to helping each other in times of need. It also provides economic security and boosts productivity. \nAs an immediate step, the government will make new investments to support a healthier Canada, further supporting the work of Canada Health Infoway and the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement to identify and introduce innovations in the health care system. \nAs our population ages, more of us will depend on our health care system and on timely access to high-quality care, regardless of where we live, or our ability to pay. Protecting the integrity of our health care system is of utmost importance to our government. We know that innovation, collaboration and partnerships are a critical part of the solution. \nAs part of the boost in new annual funding for discovery research, we will provide an additional $30 million per year to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. \nThe Minister of Health is actively engaged in discussions with territorial and provincial ministers of health, health sector stakeholders and Canadians on how best to invest in our system for long-term benefit. Home care and a patient-centred approach are part of these discussions, and our government is committed to providing the federal leadership needed in health care for the benefit of all Canadians. \nSeniors \nAn integral part of the middle class dream is a secure and dignified retirement. For too many Canadians, it has become impossible to save enough before reaching retirement age. \nToo many seniors live in poverty—in particular single seniors. \nWe will help the most vulnerable seniors by increasing the Guaranteed Income Supplement for single seniors by up to $947 annually. This enhancement more than doubles the current maximum top-up and represents a 10 per cent increase in maximum benefits that will improve the financial security of about 900,000 single seniors across Canada. \nTo help more Canadians achieve a secure retirement, I am personally committed to reaching an agreement with my provincial and territorial counterparts before the end of the year to enhance our Canada Pension Plan. \nVeterans \nOur veterans have dedicated their lives to the defence of their country. They deserve our gratitude, our respect and our support. \nWe made a solemn promise that they will have it. And we will keep that promise. \nWe will increase the Disability Award for injuries or illnesses resulting from military service, and align it with other New Veterans Charter benefits by indexing it to inflation. \nWe will expand access to higher grades of the Permanent Impairment Allowance to better support veterans who have had their career options limited by a service-related illness or injury. \nWe will increase the Earnings Loss Benefit to provide income replacement of 90 per cent of pre-release salary for injured veterans, and index this benefit so that it keeps pace with inflation. \nCanada’s veterans have also earned access to more in-person government services right in their communities. With this budget, we are providing additional funding to Veterans Affairs Canada so that it can reopen service offices recently shuttered in Charlottetown, Sydney, Corner Brook, Windsor, Thunder Bay, Saskatoon, Brandon, Prince George and Kelowna. We’re also planning to open a new office in Surrey, B.C., and expand our outreach in northern Canada. \nTo help veterans in their rehabilitation process, we will enhance front-line services by hiring additional case managers to reduce the client-to-case manager ratio to no more than 25:1. \nStatus of Women \nI am also proud to announce that we will increase the funding of Status of Women Canada to increase the Agency’s capacity to support gender-based analysis across the federal government and expand their regional presence to support local organizations working on women’s issues and gender equality. \nI recently appointed the government’s Advisory Council on Economic Growth that will advise us as we build a longer-term growth strategy—and I am proud of the fact that the majority of the experienced business and economic leaders we’ve selected are women. \nHelping the Less Fortunate \nTo meet the continuing and growing demand for affordable housing across the country, I am proud to announce that the government will double the amount that it provides to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s Affordable Housing Initiative. Thousands of families will benefit from the measures contained in this budget to support affordable housing. \nOur government will also invest an additional $112 million over the next two years in the Homelessness Strategy to help the various segments of the population that are directly affected. \nOver the next two years, we will fund and support the construction or renovation of over 3,000 shelter spaces or transition homes for victims of violence. This is the largest single investment in support of victims of violence in our country’s history. \nA New Relationship With Indigenous Peoples \nWe simply cannot claim to be successful as a country as long as Indigenous peoples aren’t given every chance to succeed. \nIn economic terms, the arguments are irrefutable. With an aging population, the Canadian economy needs more workers. The Indigenous population is young and growing. It could help. But that can’t happen until First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples have a path to prosperity. And that means investments. \nI have met with First Nations and Indigenous leaders and community members on several occasions, including during pre-budget consultations in Winnipeg. I commit to maintaining this relationship throughout my tenure as Finance Minister. \nI am honoured to announce on behalf of the government historic investments of $8.4 billion over the next five years, to ensure Indigenous peoples share in Canada’s prosperity. \nThis is in keeping with the spirit of the Kelowna Accord, concluded in 2005 thanks to the inspired leadership of former Prime Minister Paul Martin. \nAlmost half that money will be invested in education. We will build schools. We will hire teachers. We will ensure that Indigenous children get the education they need and deserve. \nHousing is also an urgent need. The government will invest nearly $555 million over two years. So is health care. The government will invest to repair and build nursing stations and residences for health care workers in Indigenous communities. \nFinally, we will put an end to the unconscionable crisis of boil-water advisories on reserves. Our government will invest nearly $2 billion in water and wastewater infrastructure and drinking water monitoring over five years so that every Canadian child has access to clean drinking water, no matter where they live. \nOur Commitment to the World \nLast November, the government committed $678 million over six years, starting in 2015–16, to resettle 25,000 Syrian refugees by February 29, 2016, and today we are committing new funding to resettle an additional 10,000 government-assisted Syrian refugees over the course of 2016. \nThis is an issue that is very close to me personally, having been involved in efforts to provide education and opportunity to Somali and South Sudanese girls in the Kakuma Refugee Camp over the past decade. I’ve been moved by the warmth, caring and resilience of people who have given up so much to flee conflict in search of a better life for themselves and their families. \nThis fall, I was doubly moved by the outpouring of support and the welcome Canada reserved for Syrian refugees. I believe the world saw the best of Canada in our response to this crisis, and I thank the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship for his leadership. \nWe know that newcomers are vital to the Canadian economy, and so our government will welcome 300,000 new permanent residents in 2016. \nWe believe families belong together. Family reunification contributes to the well-being of all Canadians by contributing to our collective wealth, in both sociocultural and economic terms. \nBy stepping up our efforts in this area, we anticipate 20,000 admissions under the Parent and Grandparent Program, bringing celebration and hope for thousands of Canadians who for too long have been living a world away from loved ones. \nDefence \nThe government is steadfast in its commitment to providing greater security for Canadians. Led by the Minister of National Defence, we will conduct an open and transparent process to create a new defence strategy that will deliver a modern, more agile and better-equipped military. \nOver the course of 2016, we will seek the input of Canadians, experts, allies and partners, as well as Parliament, on a new defence strategy. \nThe government is committed to renewing the major equipment of the Canadian Armed Forces, including Canada’s aging fleets of CF-18 fighter aircraft and maritime warships. \nTo ensure that funding is available when key capital acquisitions will be made, we will reallocate funding for large-scale capital projects from the 2015–16 to 2020–21 period to future years. This funding is being shifted into future years to align with the timing of major equipment acquisitions. \nA Strong Voice \nOur voice is now heard loud and clear on the international stage. Since November, we have signed an historic greenhouse gas emission reduction agreement in Paris. \nWe have renewed and revitalized our relationship with our most important partner, the United States, and signed a new continental energy and environmental agreement that includes Mexico. \nWe have significantly increased our contribution to the multinational coalition against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. \nAnd we have led the charge on the need to invest in order to boost economic growth at international economic forums such as Davos and the G20. \nConclusion \nMr. Speaker, We believe the time has come to invest to build a strong and prosperous country. \nToday, we are seizing the opportunity to invest in people and the economy, and to prepare Canada for a brighter future. \nOf course, this is only the beginning. Today we have taken some big steps in a long journey. We have much work ahead of us. \nAs we do that work, we remember that while we may act in the present we do not act for the present. \nWe act for the years and decades to come. We act for our children and our children’s children. We act so that they may inherit a more prosperous and more hopeful Canada. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. \n"]
